## Initial setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment has setup based on the official documentation: [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and [building a web application with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).

## Steps

1. [Download](https://www.pdftron.com/documentation/web/download/web/) and unzip the WebViewer package, then place it in the root folder.

2. To run the app:

- Web: install Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you have not. Then run `flutter run -d chrome`.

- Android:
Check that your Android device is running by running the command `flutter devices`. If none are available, follow the device set up instructions in the [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guides for your platform. Then, run the app with the command `flutter run` or `flutter run -d ` followed by the device id.

- iOS:
Check that your iOS device is running by running the command `flutter devices`. If none are available, follow the device set up instructions in the [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guides for your platform. Then, run the app with the command `flutter run` or `flutter run -d ` followed by the device id.
